**next time pt2**
- incorperate story of the player being some sort of time traveler and having to behave normally like a peasent in that time
- just add more npcs in the traveling map
- alter village scene (turn it into another transversable map?)
- update dialogue to be more educational and informational about the time period (it is a good game but very generic rpg style rn)
- luck aspect should be more apparent (either add a sound affect or a cue in the dialogue after you gain luck)
- convert .wav to .mp3 files (so the sound can work properly)
- 

**things to change for next time**
- add a mechanic that will add to ur resources instead of just removing them (ex. wandering merchant)
- program village scenes (they'd have to be different for each village... so 3 scenes i guess)
- implement dialogue addon to make branching choices more easy to use
- edit the bandit homing behavior
    if you choose to escape, maybe include a sort of mini game that depends if you can actually escape or not
    the homing behavior removes player automony and gets kind of annoying after a bit
  **make the bandit move slower to imply that the player can escape them**
  or have some sort of range on the bandit that changes its movement when it get closer to the player
