**things to change for next time**
- add a mechanic that will add to ur resources instead of just removing them (ex. wandering merchant)
- program village scenes (they'd have to be different for each village... so 3 scenes i guess)
- implement dialogue addon to make branching choices more easy to use
- edit the bandit homing behavior
    if you choose to escape, maybe include a sort of mini game that depends if you can actually escape or not
    the homing behavior removes player automony and gets kind of annoying after a bit
  **make the bandit move slower to imply that the player can escape them**
  or have some sort of range on the bandit that changes its movement when it get closer to the player
