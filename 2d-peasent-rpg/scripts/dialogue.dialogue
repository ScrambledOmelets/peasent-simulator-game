The year is circa 1580 and Queen Elizabeth I of England is on the throne.
You are going to market today to sell some of the excess produce from your farm.
The recent rainstorms have changed up the path and you need to proceed carefully.
You feel...
- Nervous
	Your Consciousness: I mean, who wouldn't be nervous? There's bandits around here!
	do! SignalBus.playSound(SignalBus.posSound)
	set SignalBus.luck = 1
- Determined
	Your Consciousness: I'm going to make it to market and make a ton of money!
	do! SignalBus.playSound(SignalBus.posSound)
	set SignalBus.luck = 1
- Bored
	Your Consciousness: I don't really want to be out here anyways... [do! SignalBus.playSound(SignalBus.negSound)]
	set SignalBus.luck = 0
=>< luck_explain
You almost forgot to double check your item pouch. You remember packing...
- Lightly
	set SignalBus.food = 4
	set SignalBus.gold = 5
	set SignalBus.playerSpeedMultiplier = 1.5
	This means you should have {{SignalBus.food}} food and {{SignalBus.gold}} gold!
	You feel a bit lighter.
- Moderately
	set SignalBus.food = 5
	set SignalBus.gold = 8
	This means you should have {{SignalBus.food}} food and {{SignalBus.gold}} gold!
	Your pack weighs you down a moderate amount.
	set SignalBus.playerSpeedMultiplier = 1
- Heavily
	set SignalBus.food = 10
	set SignalBus.gold = 10
	set SignalBus.playerSpeedMultiplier = 0.8
	This means you should have {{SignalBus.food}} food and {{SignalBus.gold}} gold!
	You find it difficult to move with the weight of your pack.
Follow the path to get to a village safetly and sell your produce.
There is a counter at the top left corner to help you rememember your items.
You wonâ€™t be able to make it if you run out of food, so keep an eye on your resources.
Hopefully your journey is a successful one!

	Oh, what was that noise? You feel a little less lucky.
	Whenever you hear that sound, it means you made a questionable decision.
Keep making choices and see what happens.
